GitHub contributions cheat. Generates a random number of commits
following a gamma distribution:

![PDF plot](./plot.png)

Distribution type and parametrization based on my humble GitHub activity stats
research.

I did it for the lulz. I know that it's dumb, and that people don't like old
memes. Just don't bug me and yourself.

## Setup

Create a fork and run the setup script:
```sh
git clone git@github.com:rnln/cch.git
cd cch
python3 setup.py
```

Setup module creates a virtual environment in `/path/to/cch/venv/` and a cron
job to run `cch.py` daily. Job sample:
```
* * 0 0 0 /home/user/cch/venv/bin/python /home/user/cch/cch.py # CCh
```
